    <p>If this is your first time at a club meeting, then this is the page for you. There are a few housekeeping items we ask you to complete before getting started on the coding.</p>

    <h1>Step 0</h1>

    <a href="https://girlswhocode.secure.force.com/clubenrollment/">Fill out the online student enrollment form</a>

    <p><ul>
      <li>For the Club Name, enter "Bothell Library".</li>
      <li>Uncheck the forms and consent box at the bottom if desired. You'll fill this out on paper.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h1>Step 1</h1>
    <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/clubpresurvey">Fill out the GWC research survey</a>

    <p>It should take around 10 minutes. There are no wrong answers; it's just a way for GWC to get a feel of your attitudes towards and knowledge of Computer Science before your time with the club.</p>

    <h1>Step 2</h1>
    Sign up for important club updates by either:

    <ul>
      <li>Sending a text message to <code>81010</code> with the message <code>@f3973b</code></li>
      <li>Going to <a href="https://www.remind.com/join/f3973b">https://www.remind.com/join/f3973b</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the event of a cancellation or other important update, we'll send out a text message to all club members and their parents, but only if you sign up for them!</p>

    <h1>Step 5</h1>

    <a href="https://www.codesters.com">Sign up for Codesters</a>

    <p>Codesters is used for level 1 modules and teaches basic Python programming in an online environment.</p>

    <p>Class key: <code>0a9d1a</code></p>

    <h1>That's it!</h1>
    <p>Join in with the rest of the club or ask an instructor for what to do next.</p>
