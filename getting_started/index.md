    <p>If this is your first time at a club meeting, then this is the page for you. There are a few housekeeping items we ask you complete before getting started on the coding.</p>

    <h1>Step 0</h1>

    <a href="https://girlswhocode.secure.force.com/clubenrollment/">Fill out the online student enrollment form</a>

    <p><ul>
      <li>For the Club Name, enter "Bothell Library".</li>
      <li>Uncheck the forms and consent box at the bottom if desired. You'll fill this out on paper.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h1>Step 1</h1>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1T8zHskTHVGXuT-8hePNO-LvdonS9-posLkIzSMIlTiU/viewform">Fill out the GWC research survey</a>

    <p>It should take around 15-20 minutes. There are no wrong answers; it's just a way for GWC to get a feel of your attitudes towards and knowledge of Computer Science before your time with the club.</p>

    <h1>Step 2</h1>
    <p>Print a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuNWpWTtNYJT-iwnPEUGSKrhKEdWZndB-phR-LMs2yU/edit">the Club Pledge</a>, read, sign, and hand it in to an instructor.</p>

    <h1>Step 3</h1>
    <p>Print a copy of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9DaxkWbFZbTazgwM1cybmxXc00/view">the Media Release Form</a>, have it signed by a parent, and return it to an instructor.</p>

    <h1>Step 4</h1>
    <a href="https://girlswhocode.instructure.com/enroll/LE3DBL">Sign up for Canvas</a>

    <p>Canvas is a Learning Management System that is the center of education in a Girls Who Code Club. Assignments, pre/post Tests, and more are all stored in Canvas for accessibility and ease.</p>

    <p>If you are a parent signing up a student, please ensure that your student knows the email address and password of her Canvas account so she can get to the assignments!</p>

    <h1>Step 5</h1>

    <a href="https://www.codesters.com">Sign up for Codesters</a>

    <p>Codesters is used for level 1 modules and teaches basic Python programming in an online environment.</p>

    <p>Class key: <code>0a9d1a</code></p>

    <h1>That's it!</h1>
    <p>Join in with the rest of the club or ask an instructor for what to do next.</p>
